# Ethical Hacking Portfolio

**Ethical Notice**

This repository documents my learning and lab work for an ethical hacking program. All testing, scanning, and exploitation performed and recorded here is done in controlled lab environments that I own or have explicit permission to test. I do **not** perform unauthorized testing against third-party systems.

If you intend to reproduce any labs, ensure you have clear written permission for any target system, follow applicable laws and organizational policies, and prioritize safety and privacy.
